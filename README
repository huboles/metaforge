a pattern driven static site generator for extensible snippet insertion.

the full documentation is available in this repository under the **files/README/source/docs**
directory. it's currently setup as a working example of a metaforge site, so you can poke around
and see one way a site can be setup.

building documentation:
    $ cargo test -- --ignored readme

this command can be run as many times as needed to regenerate the documentation, and is
reccomended after upgrading to a new version to see what's changed.
