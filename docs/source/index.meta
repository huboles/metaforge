this is the documentation for metaforge, generated by metaforge itself.

currently it's unstyled html rendered by your browser, so it's pretty bare-bones.

open **docs/source** in metaforge's repository and explore the source and pattern
files to get some examples of how this site works.

you can change anything in the **docs** directory and see how it affects the site once
you rebuild it.
