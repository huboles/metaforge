## file locations
metaforge parses files with the **.meta** extension.

files in the pattern directory are available for file expansion.
**default.meta** files are fallback files if the pattern directory
gets called without a defined value.

the structure of the source directory gets mirrored to the build
directory as the site is build, with any **.meta** files
becoming **.html** files, except **default.meta** files,
which define default values for a directory and its children.

the source section of files in the source directory can be written
in markdown and will converted to html.

files from the pattern directory the should generally contain html snippets,
but can contain anything that you'd like to substitute.

required directories are:

- source (site structure and contents)
- pattern (patterns for expansion)
- pattern/base (gets expanded to start building each pattern)

the build directory doesn't need to exist, as metaforge will create a
new one if it's missing

a new skeleton site can be built in the given root directory by passing
the ***\-\-new*** flag to metaforge,
