    title = 'metaforge documentation'
}

this is the documentation for metaforge, generated by metaforge itself.

currently it's unstyled html rendered by your browser, so it's pretty bare-bones right now, but
you can change that easily.

open **files/README** in metaforge's repository, and explore the source and pattern
files to get a glimpse into a working project.
